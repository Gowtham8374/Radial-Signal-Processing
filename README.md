# Radial Signal Processing

Radial Signal Processing is a project focused on analyzing and interpreting signals captured in radial or polar coordinate systems. This type of processing is common in applications like radar, medical imaging (ultrasound, CT), circular antenna arrays, and rotating sensor systems.

## Features

- Conversion between Cartesian and polar domains
- Radial filtering and enhancement techniques
- Time-frequency analysis for radial data
- Support for circular and spherical array processing
- Visualization tools for polar data
- Simulation and analysis of radial signal propagation

## Use Cases

- Radar signal processing
- Medical imaging (e.g., ultrasound, CT scan)
- Seismic wave analysis
- Sonar and underwater acoustics
- Circular microphone/antenna arrays

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- (Optional) PyTorch or TensorFlow for ML models
- (Optional) Jupyter for interactive visualization

Install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt
